    <h2>Security Measures:🔐</h2>
    <h4>JWT  (JSON Web Tokens):</h4>
    <p>JWTs are used to securely transmit information between the client and server. Each token contains encoded user information and a signature to verify the token's authenticity. Upon successful login, the server generates a token and sends it to the client, which stores it (usually in localStorage or cookies).
         For subsequent requests, the token is sent in the HTTP headers to authenticate and authorize the user.</p>
    <h4>bcrypt</h4>
    <p>bcrypt is a password-hashing library used to securely store user passwords. When a user registers, their password is hashed using bcrypt before being saved to the database. When logging in, the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash to verify the user’s identity. 
        This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure.</p> 
    <h3>Learned new things</h3>
    <p>Styled-Components in CSS: Implemented CSS-in-JS with styled-components, allowing for dynamic styling based on component props and state, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.</p>
    <h4>Outcome😊💻</h4>
    <p>The Fitness Logger application provides a complete solution for fitness enthusiasts, offering tools for tracking, analyzing, and achieving fitness goals. The full-stack design ensures robust performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience.</p>
